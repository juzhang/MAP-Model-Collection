# Musculoskeletal Atlas Project Models

This repository contains the meshes and PCA shape models released as a part of the Musculoskeletal Atlas Project (MAP) database.

These models are intended to be used with the [MAP Client](https://map-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) ([tutorial](http://map-client-fai-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)).

Each top-level folder in this repository contains the reference meshes and PCA shape models of an anatomical structure (currently bones).

## Lower-limb

Mean meshes and combined shape model of the lower limb (pelvis to tibia-fibula) trained on 26 subjects. These models are also found in the MAP Client plugin [fieldworklowerlimb2sidegenerationstep](https://github.com/mapclient-plugins/fieldworklowerlimb2sidegenerationstep).
